                <p className="m-2">I knew of netlify's free tier and support for static site generators and front end web apps and websites. I redesigned the website after taking a UI/UX course from Udemy, using HTML, CSS JavaScript, and a static site generator called 11ty. the blogging capabilities were reserved, as the client could now write in markdown files and insert them into a "blogs" folder to dynamically assemble a page for the new blog.</p>
                <p className='m-2'>The project gave me an understanding of creating custom wordpress themes using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to create a wordpress theme. Later the use of  11ty with "Nunjucks" as a templating language allowed for me to use templates and inserting of blogs through markdown files.</p>
